# PRODIGY_CS_01
The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. It's named after Julius Caesar, who used it for secure communication.
